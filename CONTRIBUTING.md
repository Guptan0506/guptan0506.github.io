# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! A few guidelines:

- Open an issue first to discuss major changes.
- Keep changes in feature branches and open pull requests with clear descriptions.
- For the `query-performance-dashboard` React project, run `npm install` and `npm test` before submitting PRs.
- Add tests for bug fixes and new features where feasible.

If you'd like, I can add a GitHub Actions workflow that runs tests and lints the `query-performance-dashboard` project.
